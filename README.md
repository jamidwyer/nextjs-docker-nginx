# nextjs-docker-nginx

## Description

I needed to refresh my Docker and nginx skills to troubleshoot an ongoing problem with dev environments at work, so I worked through [this post](https://steveholgado.com/nginx-for-nextjs/#creating-a-simple-nextjs-app) and now I have this simple boilerplate for a Dockerized next.js project.

## Setup

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

To create a new next.js project based on this boilerplate, run:
`git clone git@github.com:jamidwyer/nextjs-docker-nginx.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`

## Dev

`docker-compose up`
